# Andrew Ellison Portfolio

This is my personal website portfolio showcasing my current projects and giving background about myself. Some images are placeholders at the moment, and will be updated as I develop more web based applications.

My goal with the projects section is to directly show off the results of my research methods in creating visualizations of complex data. However, instead of linking to the application that created these visualizations I have linked to my Ph.D. Thesis, as the codebase for this processing was created before I employed version control and archiving practices. I may upload my previous code at some point in the future.

## Main Features
- Sections about me, my projects, and how to contact me
- Responsive layout based on the user's screen size, specifically in reordering images as columns and moving column headers.
- Links to each of the relevant sections can be found on the Navbar at the top of the page.
- Code is accessible and utilizes alt tags for all images
